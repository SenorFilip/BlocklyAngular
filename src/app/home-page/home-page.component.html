        Loops or iterations are used for repeating sequences of code. They're wery usefull for many programming problems.<br>
        Python has a WHILE and a FOR loop. We're gonna focus on the FOR loop.
        The loop consist of three pieces:<br>
        - begin: n = 1<br>
        - end: n <= 6<br>
        - change: n += 1<br>
        <br>
        Begin is the first value in the range. The default value is 0.<br>
        End is the last value which the current value can't pass.<br>
        Change is the amount by which we increment or decrement the current value.<br>
        <br>
        The print() method writes it's content to the console.<br>
        <b>Now, write a loop which writes values from 24 to 0 in decrements of 3. Good luck!</b>
