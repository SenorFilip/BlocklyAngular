      <div class="panel-body text-success">
        Variables are like labels, that store data, think of them as containers with labels. They let you store data to use later in a program.<br><br>

        <img src="/assets/images/boxes.png" alt="image" width="600"><br><br>

        To create a variable in Python, you’ll use a variable name, an equal sign (=), and a value, as shown in the figure below.<br><br>

        <img src="/assets/images/variable.png" alt="image" width="400"><br>

        Variables can store numbers, words, and even complete sentences, such as "Hello reader, my name is Vin!".<br>
        Here's another example:<br><br>

        <div class="panel panel-info text-box">
          <div class="panel-body">
            weather = "cloudy"<br>
          </div>
        </div>

        Here, the variable container's name is weather (left side), and its value is "cloudy" (right side.)<br>
        <hr>

        You need to know a few syntax rules for naming variables so Python can understand them: <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Variable containers are case sensitive, which means that the name var is different from Var, vAr, and VAR</li>
          <li>Don’t include symbols in your variable names, except for underscores (_), or you’ll get a syntax error</li>
          <li>White space inside the variable name is not allowed also</li>
          <li>Don’t start a variable name with a number, as in 3player. Using numbers elsewhere in a variable name is fine, as in player3</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="panel panel-info text-box">
          <div class="panel-body">
            fav_num = 3  # correct<br>
            !fav_num = 3 # wrong<br>
            @fav_num = 3 # wrong<br>
            1fav_num = 3 # wrong<br>
            =fav_num = 3 # wrong<br>
          </div>
        </div>

        In Python code, anything after a # symbol in a statement is a comment and is <b>IGNORED</b> by the Python Interpreter<br>
        You don’t need to add spaces on either side of the equal sign: your program will run fine without them. <br>
        But they do make the code easier to read, so it’s a good idea to add them. <br>
        For example player='Little Vin' is equal to player = 'Little Vin' , adding space just makes them more readable.
